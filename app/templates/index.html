          <p class="body-copy-medium vertical-spacing-bottom-2">Weâ€™re helping charities to work together by getting them to share information about their ongoing projects, whatever stage they're at.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-medium vertical-spacing-bottom-0-5">By charities, for charities</h2>
          <p class="body-copy-medium vertical-spacing-bottom-2">This is for charities who want to collaborate with each other to build better digital services. It aims to reduce wasted effort by showing what is already being thought about and done, and inviting offers of help/assistance.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-medium vertical-spacing-bottom-0-5">Share your pipeline</h2>
          <p class="body-copy-medium vertical-spacing-bottom-0-5">For everyone to get the most out of this platform, we need organisations like yours to share the solutions you're thinking about, researching and building.</p>
          <p class="body-copy-medium vertical-spacing-bottom-2">Please complete <a href="#" target="_blank">this form</a> and we'll be in touch about adding your organisation's development pipeline. It's as simple for you as filling in a Google Spreadsheet.</p>
